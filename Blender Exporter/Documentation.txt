Blender exporter for pbrt-v3
----------------------------
by Jonathan Klein



This exporter is far from being complete, but it can export basic scenes. Here are a few things to look out for:

- All Objects / Cameras / etc. will be set to quaternion rotation mode by the script. This could maybe be fixed.
- A scene can only have one camera.
- All material properties except for the dedicated pbrt material properties are ignored.
- Each file has to start with 'Scale -1 1 1' which technically should not be needed. Though right now it is the simplest solution to get things right...
- All objects must have materials assigned to them
- parenting can result in wrong transformations (not supported hence)
- smooth / hard shaded normals are a problem, too

TODO:
=====
- doesn't write scene description file for rendering, but pass it directly to pbrt
- enable all properties for pbrt renderer (especially object data, the window is empty for now)
